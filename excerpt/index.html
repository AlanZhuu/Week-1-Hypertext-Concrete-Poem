                'Fair, fair,' cry the ospreys

On the island in the river.

Lovely is this noble lady,

Fit bride for our lord.

 

In patches grows the water mallow:

To left and right one must seek it.

<a href="#" class="dead-link" >
    Shy was this noble lady;
</a>; 


Day and night he sought her.

 

Sought her and could not get her;

Day and night he grieved.

<a href="#" class="dead-link" >
    Long thoughts, oh, long unhappy thoughts,
</a>


Now on his back, now tossing on to his side.

 

In patches grow the water mallow;

To left and right one must gather it.

<a href="#" class="dead-link" >
    Shy is this noble lady;
</a>; 


With great zithern and little we 
<span id="ghost" >
    hearten her.
</span>.
